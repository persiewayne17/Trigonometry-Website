    <h2>Trigonometric Functions</h2>

    <p>
      Trigonometric functions are functions that relate the angles of a triangle
      to the lengths of its sides. The most common trigonometric functions are
      sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). These functions are essential
      in understanding various concepts in mathematics, especially in geometry
      and trigonometry.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Graphs of Trigonometric Functions</h3>
    <p>
      The graphs of trigonometric functions show how these functions change with
      different angles. The most commonly graphed functions are sine, cosine,
      and tangent.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sine and Cosine Graphs</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The graphs of the sine and cosine functions are wavy and periodic, meaning
      they repeat their shape every 360° (or 2π radians).
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        <strong>Sine Graph:</strong> Starts at 0, reaches a maximum of 1 at 90°
        (π/2 radians), goes back to 0 at 180° (π radians), reaches a minimum of
        -1 at 270° (3π/2 radians), and returns to 0 at 360° (2π radians).
      </p>
      <img src="sineG.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="333" />
      <p>
        <strong>Cosine Graph:</strong> Starts at 1, decreases to 0 at 90° (π/2
        radians), reaches a minimum of -1 at 180° (π radians), goes back to 0 at
        270° (3π/2 radians), and returns to 1 at 360° (2π radians).
      </p>
      <img src="cosG.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="333" />
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tangent Graph</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The tangent function graph has a different shape; it repeats every 180° (π
      radians).
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        The graph of the tangent function has vertical asymptotes (lines the
        graph approaches but never touches) at 90° (π/2 radians), 270° (3π/2
        radians), etc., where the function is undefined.
      </p>

    </div>

    <h3>2. Solving Trigonometric Equations</h3>
    <p>
      Solving trigonometric equations involves finding the angles that make a
      trigonometric equation true.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic Example</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        Consider the equation <strong>sin x = 0.5</strong>. To solve this, you
        need to find the angle x for which the sine is 0.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the unit circle or a calculator, you find that
        <strong>x = 30°</strong> (or x = π/6 radians) is a solution. However,
        since sine is periodic, <strong>x = 30° + 360°n</strong> or
        <strong>x = 150° + 360°n</strong> (where n is any integer) are also
        solutions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>General Approach</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To solve more complex equations, you often need to use identities, inverse
      functions, or graphical methods.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Maximum and Minimum Points of Trigonometric Functions</h3>
    <p>
      The maximum and minimum points of trigonometric functions refer to the
      highest and lowest values these functions can reach.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sine and Cosine Functions</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The maximum value of the sine and cosine functions is 1, and the minimum
      value is -1.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        For example, in the sine function <strong>y = sin x</strong>, the
        maximum point is at y = 1 and occurs at x = 90° (π/2 radians), while the
        minimum point is at y = -1 and occurs at x = 270° (3π/2 radians).
      </p>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tangent Function</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The tangent function does not have a maximum or minimum value because it
      can increase or decrease without bound. However, it has points where the
      function crosses the x-axis (called zeros) and vertical asymptotes where
      the function is undefined.
    </p>

    <p>
      These concepts are fundamental for understanding how trigonometric
      functions behave and are applied in solving various mathematical problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Solving Trigonometric Equations</h2>

    <p>
      Solving trigonometric equations involves finding the values of the
      angle(s) that satisfy a given trigonometric equation. These equations
      often involve functions like sine, cosine, or tangent.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Basic Steps to Solve Trigonometric Equations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Isolate the Trigonometric Function:</strong> Try to get the
        trigonometric function (like <em>sin x</em>, <em>cos x</em>, or
        <em>tan x</em>) by itself on one side of the equation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Solve for the Angle:</strong> Use the inverse trigonometric
        function (like <em>sin<sup>-1</sup></em
        >, <em>cos<sup>-1</sup></em
        >, or <em>tan<sup>-1</sup></em
        >) to find the angle that corresponds to the trigonometric value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consider All Possible Solutions:</strong> Since trigonometric
        functions are periodic, there may be multiple angles that satisfy the
        equation within a given range. You must find all possible solutions by
        considering the periodic nature of the function.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Example 1: Solving a Sine Equation</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Equation:</strong> Solve <em>sin x = 0.5</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, we find the basic angle using the inverse sine function:
          <em>x = sin<sup>-1</sup>(0.5)</em>.
        </li>
        <li>We know that <em>sin 30° = 0.5</em>, so <em>x = 30°</em>.</li>
        <li>
          However, since the sine function is periodic, we also have a solution
          at <em>x = 180° - 30° = 150°</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Therefore, the general solutions are <em>x = 30° + 360°n</em> and
          <em>x = 150° + 360°n</em>, where <em>n</em> is any integer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Example 2: Solving a Cosine Equation</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Equation:</strong> Solve <em>cos x = -1/2</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start by finding the basic angle: <em>x = cos<sup>-1</sup>(-1/2)</em>.
        </li>
        <li>We know that <em>cos 120° = -1/2</em>, so <em>x = 120°</em>.</li>
        <li>
          For cosine, another solution is given by
          <em>x = 360° - 120° = 240°</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Therefore, the general solutions are <em>x = 120° + 360°n</em> and
          <em>x = 240° + 360°n</em>, where <em>n</em> is any integer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Example 3: Solving a Tangent Equation</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Equation:</strong> Solve <em>tan x = 1</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find the basic angle: <em>x = tan<sup>-1</sup>(1) </em>.</li>
        <li>We know that <em>tan 45° = 1</em>, so <em>x = 45° </em>.</li>
        <li>
          Tangent has a period of 180°, so the general solution is
          <em>x = 45° + 180°n</em>, where <em>n</em> is any integer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Example of Solving a Story Problem</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        <strong>Equation:</strong>Solve, two friends, Rakesh and Vishal started
        climbing a pyramid-shaped hill. Rakesh climbs 315 m and finds that the
        angle of depression is 72.3 degrees from his starting point. How high is
        he from the ground?.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong>Let m is the height above the ground.</p>
      <p>To find: Value of m</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To solve m, use the sine ratio.</li>
        <li>sin 72.3° = m/315</li>
        <li>0.953= m/315</li>
        <li>m = 315 x 0.953</li>
        <li>m = 300.195 mtr <br />The man is 300.195 mtr above the ground.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Example Solving a Story Problem</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>
        <strong>Equation:</strong>Solve, A man is observing a pole of height 55
        foot. According to his measurement, pole cast a 23 feet long shadow. Can
        you help him to know the angle of elevation of the sun from the tip of
        shadow?
      </p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Let x be the angles of elevation of the sun, then</li>
        <li>tan x = 55/23 = 2.391</li>
        <li>x = tan<sup>-1</sup>(2.391)</li>
        <li>x = 67.30°</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Key Points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trigonometric equations can have multiple solutions because of the
        periodic nature of trigonometric functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always consider the function's period when finding all possible
        solutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a calculator can help find the basic angle, but understanding the
        function's behavior is crucial for finding all solutions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These steps and examples should help you solve basic trigonometric
      equations and understand the importance of considering all possible
      solutions.
