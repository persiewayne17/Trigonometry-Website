    <h2>Trigonometric Functions</h2>

    <p>Trigonometric functions are functions that relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides. The most common trigonometric functions are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). These functions are essential in understanding various concepts in mathematics, especially in geometry and trigonometry.</p>

    <h3>1. Graphs of Trigonometric Functions</h3>
    <p>The graphs of trigonometric functions show how these functions change with different angles. The most commonly graphed functions are sine, cosine, and tangent.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sine and Cosine Graphs</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The graphs of the sine and cosine functions are wavy and periodic, meaning they repeat their shape every 360° (or 2π radians).</p>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Sine Graph:</strong> Starts at 0, reaches a maximum of 1 at 90° (π/2 radians), goes back to 0 at 180° (π radians), reaches a minimum of -1 at 270° (3π/2 radians), and returns to 0 at 360° (2π radians).</p>

        <p><strong>Cosine Graph:</strong> Starts at 1, decreases to 0 at 90° (π/2 radians), reaches a minimum of -1 at 180° (π radians), goes back to 0 at 270° (3π/2 radians), and returns to 1 at 360° (2π radians).</p>
        <img src="cosG.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="333">
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tangent Graph</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The tangent function graph has a different shape; it repeats every 180° (π radians).</p>
    <div class="example">
        <p>The graph of the tangent function has vertical asymptotes (lines the graph approaches but never touches) at 90° (π/2 radians), 270° (3π/2 radians), etc., where the function is undefined.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>2. Solving Trigonometric Equations</h3>
    <p>Solving trigonometric equations involves finding the angles that make a trigonometric equation true.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Example</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example">
        <p>Consider the equation <strong>sin x = 0.5</strong>. To solve this, you need to find the angle x for which the sine is 0.5.</p>
        <p>Using the unit circle or a calculator, you find that <strong>x = 30°</strong> (or x = π/6 radians) is a solution. However, since sine is periodic, <strong>x = 30° + 360°n</strong> or <strong>x = 150° + 360°n</strong> (where n is any integer) are also solutions.</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>General Approach</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To solve more complex equations, you often need to use identities, inverse functions, or graphical methods.</p>

    <h3>3. Maximum and Minimum Points of Trigonometric Functions</h3>
    <p>The maximum and minimum points of trigonometric functions refer to the highest and lowest values these functions can reach.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sine and Cosine Functions</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The maximum value of the sine and cosine functions is 1, and the minimum value is -1.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <p>For example, in the sine function <strong>y = sin x</strong>, the maximum point is at y = 1 and occurs at x = 90° (π/2 radians), while the minimum point is at y = -1 and occurs at x = 270° (3π/2 radians).</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tangent Function</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The tangent function does not have a maximum or minimum value because it can increase or decrease without bound. However, it has points where the function crosses the x-axis (called zeros) and vertical asymptotes where the function is undefined.</p>

    <p>These concepts are fundamental for understanding how trigonometric functions behave and are applied in solving various mathematical problems.</p>


    <h2>Solving Trigonometric Equations</h2>

    <p>Solving trigonometric equations involves finding the 
values of the angle(s) that satisfy a given trigonometric 
equation. These equations often involve functions like sine, 
cosine, or tangent.</p>

    <h3>1. Basic Steps to Solve Trigonometric Equations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Isolate the Trigonometric Function:</strong> 
Try to get the trigonometric function (like <em>sin x</
em>, <em>cos x</em>, or <em>tan x</em>) by itself on one 
side of the equation.</li>
        <li><strong>Solve for the Angle:</strong> Use the inverse 
trigonometric function (like <em>sin<sup>-1</sup></em>, 
<em>cos<sup>-1</sup></em>, or <em>tan<sup>-1</sup></em>) 
to find the angle that corresponds to the trigonometric 
value.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider All Possible Solutions:</strong> 
Since trigonometric functions are periodic, there may be 
multiple angles that satisfy the equation within a given 
range. You must find all possible solutions by 
considering the periodic nature of the function.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Example 1: Solving a Sine Equation</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Equation:</strong> Solve <em>sin x = 0.5</em>.
</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, we find the basic angle using the inverse 
sine function: <em>x = sin<sup>-1</sup>(0.5)</em>.</
li>
            <li>We know that <em>sin 30° = 0.5</em>, so <em>x = 
30°</em>.</li>
            <li>However, since the sine function is periodic, we 
also have a solution at <em>x = 180° - 30° = 150°</
em>.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the general solutions are <em>x = 30° 
+ 360°n</em> and <em>x = 150° + 360°n</em>, where 
<em>n</em> is any integer.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Example 2: Solving a Cosine Equation</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Equation:</strong> Solve <em>cos x = -1/2</em>.
</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by finding the basic angle: <em>x = 
cos<sup>-1</sup>(-1/2)</em>.</li>
            <li>We know that <em>cos 120° = -1/2</em>, so <em>x = 
120°</em>.</li>
            <li>For cosine, another solution is given by <em>x = 
360° - 120° = 240°</em>.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the general solutions are <em>x = 120° 
+ 360°n</em> and <em>x = 240° + 360°n</em>, where 
<em>n</em> is any integer.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Example 3: Solving a Tangent Equation</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Equation:</strong> Solve <em>tan x = 1</em>.</
p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find the basic angle: <em>x = tan<sup>-1</sup>(1)
</em>.</li>
            <li>We know that <em>tan 45° = 1</em>, so <em>x = 45°
</em>.</li>
            <li>Tangent has a period of 180°, so the general 
solution is <em>x = 45° + 180°n</em>, where <em>n</
em> is any integer.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Example of Solving a Story Problem</h3>
    <div class="example">
     <p><strong>Equation:</strong>Solve, two friends, Rakesh and 
Vishal started climbing a pyramid-shaped hill. Rakesh climbs 
315 m and finds that the angle of depression is 72.3 degrees 
from his starting point. How high is he from the ground?.</p>
     <p><strong>Solution:</strong>Let m is the height above the 
ground.</p>
     <p>To find: Value of m</p>
     <ul>
        <li>To solve m, use the sine ratio.</li>
        <li>sin 72.3° = m/315</li>
        <li>0.953= m/315</li>
        <li>m = 315 x 0.953</li>
        <li>m = 300.195 mtr <br>The man is 300.195 mtr above the 
ground.</li>
     </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Example Solving a Story Problem</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Equation:</strong>Solve, A man is observing a 
pole of height 55 foot. According to his measurement, 
pole cast a 23 feet long shadow. Can you help him to know 
the angle of elevation of the sun from the tip of shadow? 
</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
           <li>Let x be the angles of elevation of the sun, then</
li>
            <li>tan x = 55/23 = 2.391</li>
            <li>x = tan<sup>-1</sup>(2.391)</li>
            <li>x = 67.30°</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    


    <h3>Key Points</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Trigonometric equations can have multiple solutions 
because of the periodic nature of trigonometric functions.
</li>
        <li>Always consider the function's period when finding 
all possible solutions.</li>
        <li>Using a calculator can help find the basic angle, but 
understanding the function's behavior is crucial for 
finding all solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These steps and examples should help you solve basic 
trigonometric equations and understand the importance of 
considering all possible solutions.</p>
